## Introduction

Welcome to the Industrial Copper Modeling Project! Our mission is to transform the copper industry through the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques. By developing robust models for predicting selling prices and classifying leads, we aim to revolutionize decision-making processes and drive business growth.</br></br></br>

---
## Project Objectives

1. **Enhanced Predictive Accuracy**: Traditional methods of predicting selling prices and classifying leads often fall short due to data complexities and manual intervention. Our goal is to leverage machine learning to improve accuracy and efficiency in these critical areas.

2. **Streamlined Processes**: Manual prediction and lead classification processes can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Through automation and advanced algorithms, we seek to streamline these processes, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

3. **Empowering Decision-Makers**: By providing accurate predictions and actionable insights, our models empower decision-makers within the copper industry to make informed choices that drive business success.</br></br></br>

## Key Components

### Regression Model Details

Our regression model is designed to predict selling prices by analyzing various factors such as quantity, customer data, and market trends. Key features of this model include:

- **Data Normalization**: Ensuring uniformity and consistency in data representation.
- **Outlier Detection and Handling**: Identifying and addressing anomalies in the dataset.
- **Decision Tree Algorithm**: Leveraging decision trees for accurate prediction of selling prices.

### Classification Model Details

Our classification model focuses on lead classification, categorizing leads as either 'Won' or 'Lost' based on their likelihood of conversion. Key features of this model include:

- **Utilization of Status Variable**: Leveraging the 'STATUS' variable to classify leads as 'Won' or 'Lost'.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Employing decision tree algorithms for efficient lead classification.</br></br></br>

## Solution Overview

Our solution comprises the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Analyzing data for skewness, outliers, and data format issues. Preprocessing data to ensure suitability for modeling.
   
2. **Model Development**: Building machine learning models for regression and classification tasks using appropriate algorithms and techniques.

3. **Streamlit Application**: Creating an interactive Streamlit application for easy access to model predictions. Users can input relevant data and obtain predicted selling prices or lead classification outcomes.</br></br></br>
