## Project Objectives

1. **Enhanced Predictive Accuracy**: Traditional methods of predicting selling prices and classifying leads often fall short due to data complexities and manual intervention. Our goal is to leverage machine learning to improve accuracy and efficiency in these critical areas.

2. **Streamlined Processes**: Manual prediction and lead classification processes can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Through automation and advanced algorithms, we seek to streamline these processes, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

3. **Empowering Decision-Makers**: By providing accurate predictions and actionable insights, our models empower decision-makers within the copper industry to make informed choices that drive business success.</br></br></br>

## Key Components

### Regression Model Details

Our regression model is designed to predict selling prices by analyzing various factors such as quantity, customer data, and market trends. Key features of this model include:

- **Data Normalization**: Ensuring uniformity and consistency in data representation.
- **Outlier Detection and Handling**: Identifying and addressing anomalies in the dataset.
- **Decision Tree Algorithm**: Leveraging decision trees for accurate prediction of selling prices.

### Classification Model Details

Our classification model focuses on lead classification, categorizing leads as either 'Won' or 'Lost' based on their likelihood of conversion. Key features of this model include:

- **Utilization of Status Variable**: Leveraging the 'STATUS' variable to classify leads as 'Won' or 'Lost'.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Employing decision tree algorithms for efficient lead classification.</br></br></br>
